The player is able to choose either Obi-Wan Kenobi or Anakin Skywalker.
If the player chooses Obi-Wan Kenobi they will fly over Coruscant, duel Count Dooku, duel Magnaguards, duel Grievous, duel Anakin, etc.
If the player chooses Anakin Skywalker, they will fly over Coruscant, duel Count Dooku, fall to the dark side, duel Obi-Wan, etc.
Once finished with the game, the player will be asked if they would like to play again.
